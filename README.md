ps: we plan to use rrweb or maybe create our own package for this whole process for the open source community.

```env
ZEROPS_S3_ENDPOINT=https://your-zerops-endpoint
ZEROPS_S3_BUCKET=your-bucket-name
ZEROPS_S3_ACCESS_KEY_ID=your-access-key
ZEROPS_S3_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=your-secret-key
```

This is for demonstration purposes. We plan on integrating this feature in [Coldran](https://coldran.com) with additional security and functionality.
